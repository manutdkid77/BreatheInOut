# BreatheInOut ðŸ§˜
An iOS and Android app to visualize a breathe in breathe out animation using Lottie âœ¨.

This animation can be played/paused and its progress can be controlled by the slider.

## Inspiration

I was inspired by this lovely [dribbble UI](https://dribbble.com/shots/7214883-Countdown-Timer-DailyUI-014) and made use of [this](https://lottiefiles.com/1741-breathing-in-and-out) Lottie Animation to recreate the effect.
